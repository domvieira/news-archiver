# news-archiver

News Archiver is designed to capture screenshots of different websites, specifically news sites, and store them locally so they can be compared. Using this tool, you can easily compare how different media organizations are covering the news at any given minute. 

* Connect to Discord
* Allow you to interact with the bot in public and private message
